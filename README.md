Artisanal ü§£ bioinformatics tools and pipelines in Scala.

Install with the Conda package manager after setting up your [Bioconda channels](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html#set-up-channels):

```text
‚ùØ conda install cvbio
```

## Disambiguate

Disambiguate reads that were mapped to multiple references.

Disambiguation of aligned reads is performed per-template and all information across primary, secondary, and supplementary alignments is used as evidence.
Alignment disambiguation is commonly used when analyzing sequencing data from transduction, transfection, transgenic, or xenographic (including patient derived xenograft) experiments.
This tool works by comparing various alignment scores between a template that has been aligned to many references in order to determine which reference is the most likely source.

All templates which are positively assigned to a single source reference are written to a reference-specific output BAM file.
Any templates with ambiguous reference assignment are written to an ambiguous input-specific output BAM file.
Only BAMs produced from the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (bwa) or STAR are currently supported.

Input BAMs of arbitrary sort order are accepted, however, an internal sort to queryname will be performed unless the BAM is already in queryname sort order.
All output BAM files will be written in the same sort order as the input BAM files.
Although paired-end reads will give the most discriminatory power for disambiguation of short-read sequencing data, this tool accepts paired, single-end (fragment), and mixed pairing input data.

#### Features

- Accepts SAM/BAM sources of any sort order
- Will disambiguate an arbitrary number of BAMs, all aligned to different references
- Writes the ambiguous alignments to an ambiguous-alignment specific directory
- Extensible implementation which supports alternative disambiguation strategies
- Early benchmarks show extremely high accuracy: [Click Here](https://github.com/clintval/cvbio/blob/master/docs/benchmarks/disambiguate.md)

#### Command Line Usage

```console
‚ùØ cvbio Disambiguate -i infile1.bam infile2.bam -p insilico/disambiguated
```

#### Example

To disambiguate templates that are aligned to human (A) and mouse (B):

```
‚ùØ java -jar cvbio.jar Disambiguate -i sample.A.bam sample.B.bam -p sample/sample -n hg38 mm10

‚ùØ tree sample/
  sample/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ambiguous-alignments/

  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.A.ambiguous.bam
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.B.ambiguous.bai
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.B.ambiguous.bam
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.hg38.bai
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.hg38.bam
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.mm10.bai
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.mm10.bam
```

## IgvBoss

Take control of your IGV session from end-to-end.

If no inputs are provided, then no new sessions will be created.
Adding multiple IGV-valid locus identifiers will result in a split-window view.
You must have already configured your IGV application to allow HTTPS connections over a port.
Enable remote control through the Advanced Tab of the Preferences Window in IGV.

There are three ways to initialize IGV:

  * Let this tool connect to an already-running IGV session
  * Supply an IGV JAR file path and let this tool run it
  * Let this tool find an `igv` executable on the system PATH and run it

This tool will always attempt to connect to a running IGV application before attempting to start a new instance of IGV.
Provide a path to an IGV JAR file if no IGV applications are currently running.
If no IGV JAR file path is set, and there are no running instances of IGV, then this tool will attempt to fnd 'igv' on the system PATH and execute the application.

You can shutdown IGV on exit with the `--close-on-exit` option.
This will work regardless of how this tool initially connected to IGV and is handy for tearing down the application after your investigation is concluded.


#### Features

- Will start IGV for you if it's not already running
- Quick syntax to navigate IGV from the commandline only
- Easily re-load new files, travel to loci, and swap genomes.
- Shut IGV down with a single command `cvbio IgvBoss -x`

#### Command Line Usage

Load a BAM and interval list file into a new IGV session against the `mm10` on-disk genome.
Then go to two loci by name that are referenced in the first two name fields of the interval list.

```console
‚ùØ cvbio IgvBoss -g mm10.fa -i infile.bam targets.bed -l $(cut -f4 < targets.bed | head -n2)
```

## RelabelReferenceNames

Relabel reference sequence names in delimited data using a chromosome name mapping table.

A collection of mapping tables is maintained at the following location:

  * https://github.com/dpryan79/ChromosomeMappings

#### Features

- Optionally drop rows which have chromosome names not in the mapping file
- Replace multiple fields in a row at once using the same mapping file
- Directly write-out rows that startwith arbitrary strings (default of `#`)
- Parses any delimited data using any single character delimiter

#### Command Line Usage

Relabel the chromosomes names in a human gene annotation file.

```console
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/dpryan79/ChromosomeMappings.git
‚ùØ wget -qO- ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-96/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.96.gtf.gz \
    | gzip -dc > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.96.gtf

‚ùØ cvbio RelabelReferenceNames \
    -i Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.96.gtf \
    -o Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.96.ensembl-named.gtf \
    -m ChromosomeMappings/GRCh38_ensembl2UCSC.txt \
    --skipPrefixes '#' \
    --columns 0 \
    --drop false
```
